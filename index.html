Thanks for your interest!
<p>
My name is Dot Stillinger.
For many years I have been a summer employee in the Nature Program of the Silver Bay YMCA in Silver Bay, NY, on Lake George near Hague.
<p>
Dr. Thomas Lord, professor of biology at Indiana University in Pennsylvania and head of the Silver Bay Nature Program encouraged my interest in learning about the wildflowers on the Y campus and in the area.
<p>
As I have come to learn the names of wildflowers I have developed an interest in knowing more about their growth habits and where they like to live.  Of course, the next step is advocating for their preservation.  Fragmentation of habitat due to development presents a grave danger.
<p>
It is remarkable that almost all of the flowers presented here were found in readily accessible locations.  The diversity of plant life is exceptional in the Silver Bay area and in other areas of the Adirondacks I have explored.  The wildflowers in this collection were photographed in Silver Bay and Hague, with a few from Bolton.  The presentation is mostly intended for a Silver Bay audience so mysterious place references are to locations on the Silver Bay campus.
